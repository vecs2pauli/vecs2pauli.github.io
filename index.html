<h1>Vecs2Pauli (work in progress)</h1>

Vecs2Pauli is software which finds all Pauli stabilizers of a given quantum state. More generally, it finds all Pauli operators which map one given quantum state (given as vector) to another.

<br>
<br>

The software is work in progress and we hope to update this website soon.

<br>
<br>

The project is funded by the Leiden University Fund (<a href="https://www.luf.nl/en/news/2022/project-grants-awarded-in-autumn-2022">LUF news</a>).

  <h2>Some use cases</h2>
</div>
    
<ul>
	<li> <b>fast classical simulation of quantum circuits</b>: converting from the slow vector-based simulation to the fast stabilizer-based simulation, if possible</li>
	<li> <b>educating quantum error correction</b>: students can create quantum error-correction codes in the state-vector picture instead of the less beginner-friendly stabilizer-picture.
		Specifically, they can start by defining the logical states as vectors, and subsequently use Vecs2Pauli to ...
		<ul>
			<li>
				 ...find the stabilizers of the code space (the usual representation of a code) 
			</li>
			<li>
				 ...find errors which the code cannot correct, i.e. Pauli strings which map one vector in the span to another
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="title">
  <h2>Algorithm</h2>
</div>

The underlying algorithm of Vecs2Pauli is based on our earlier work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00931">a new data structure for simulation of quantum computing</a>, combining decision diagrams and the stabilizer formalism (accepted to the journal <a href="quantum-journal.org">Quantum</a>).
